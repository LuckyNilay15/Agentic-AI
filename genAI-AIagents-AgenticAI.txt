Gen AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content-such as text, 
images or audio- based on patterns learned from existing data.

Traditional LLM do not know about the external world and give the output based on the input. It is like a brain.
If its given the external tools then it can perform the task like what is the cheapest price of the ticket for tomorrow
or booking the ticket etc etc.

It will search the flight
decides the cheapest flight
books the flight.

This is AI Agent it is a program that takes the input, things and take action to achieve the output
using tools, memory and knowledge base.

When asking for complex tasks, LLM itself will not be able to perform it.
It can communicate with other agentic AI to perform the task.

For example a 7 day trip to New delhi in may,  the weather should be sunny all day and the price <=1600.
so Agent1 will search for the flight and Agent2 will search for the hotel and Agent3 will search for etc etc.
and finally ticket will be booked.
i.e.

Multi-step reasoning , multi-step planning, works on a complex goal autonomously.

Agentic AI is a system where one or more AI agents work together to achieve a common goal.

Overall,
Gen AI(LLM only)------------> AI Agent----------------> Agentic AI
pre-trained           takes input, decides and.      Handles multi-step goals with planning
knowledge               completes a task                  and coordination.

Agentic AI often uses Generative AI as a core component.
