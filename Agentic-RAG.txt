RAG-> Retrieval Augmented Generation
let suppose we need to file a claim in a car insurance company.
Now, for this we need to have a policy pdf which will havew the details of the steps 
to file the claim.
So, we provided the pdf and it contains the details of the steps to file the claim.
Now the rag cannot parse very big chunk of data so, it takes the pdf and do semantic search on it
and it convert in into the vector database.
Now, when we ask the rag to file a claim, it will search in the vector database and 
and we will get the answer about the steps like 
1. Login to the website
2. Click on the claim section
3. Upload the documents
4. Fill the details
5. Submit the claim etc etc.

Now, this is the basic idea of RAG.

Agentic RAG vs Traditional RAG

Agentic RAG is a type of RAG that is used to generate responses to user queries.
Now, agentic RAG is a bit smarter and can perform complex queries. It can access databases multiple times and 
can perform complex queries to get the answer.

For example why did my invoice go up this month?
Now, the agentic RAG will access the database multiple times and perform complex queries to get the answer. It will do 
autonomous reasoning to get the answer like search for the invoice, search for the policy, search for the claims etc etc.
And it will generate the answer.

For example: Your usage exceeded the limit of 1000 units.

Feature.                    RAG.           Agentic RAG
1.Retrieves context?        Yes.              Yes
2.Plans next steps           No               Yes
3.Multi-turn reasoning?      No               Yes
4.Can reason autonomously?   only Q&A         Takes steps to complete a task.
5.Uses tools/APIs?           No               Yes
